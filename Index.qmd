# Jenna Ahart

Science Writing and Communications

##### About Me

I'm a student at the George Washington University studying journalism with a minor in astrophysics. I know that pairing can appear disjointed at first glance. But it's through this logical and linguistic fusion that I've handcrafted my very own bifocal writing lens---I'm eager to focus in and unravel intricate topics, but I can also tie them back up with creative conciseness. Experienced in copywriting, digital media production, and journalism, I'm a trained writer and editor here to make complex ideas not just comprehensible, but captivating.
